# Marcus Watkins - Software Engineer

## [About Me](https://github.com/marwatk/about-me)

My first significant software project was a Risk clone for the TI-85 graphing calculator written in high school. I've been writing code ever since, as both hobbyist and professional. I'm a polyglot who picks up new tech quickly and can hit the ground running. I'm capable of designing and implementing complex software from architecture and cloud deployment down to low-level OS configuration. I'm an excellent problem solver, often the go-to for problems others can't solve.
