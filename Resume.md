# Marcus Watkins - Software Engineer

## About Me

My first significant coding project was a Risk clone for the TI-85 graphing calculator. I've been writing code ever since, as both hobbyist and professional. I love learning new tech and solving problems, especially problems no one has worked on before. I'm capable of designing and implementing complex software from architecture to low-level OS configuration.
